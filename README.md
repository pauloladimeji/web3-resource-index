# Web3 Resource Index

Community-driven index of Web3 resources, for technical and non-technical folks alike. Search through tutorials, guides, libraries, apps, jobs and communities in the Web3 space.

## Inspiration

A lot of Web3 resources are scattered all over the Internet. However, they are hard to find or reference. For a beginner (or expert), it can be hard to navigate all the resources out there. Example: If I'm a UX designer new to Web3, what are the best resources for me to explore? At the same time, as a mid-level developer working on a defi project, how do I find the most suitable open-source project or product for my use case? Same goes for Product Managers, marketers and other tech practitioners. The list goes on and on...

Web3 Resource Index is my attempt at curating and organizing these resources in an interactive format, to make them easier to find according to each person's preference. On Web3ResourceIndex.com, you can find resources according to different criteria. At this time, some of the search criteria include:

### Resource Type

- Tutorials
- Guides
- Courses
- Communities
- Job Boards
- Developer Tools & Products
- Non-developer Tools & Products
- Books & Essays

### Blockchains

- Celo
- Solana
- Ethereum
- Bitcoin
- Polygon

### Career Path

- Developer
- Product Manager
- Founder
- Product Designer
- Technical Writer
- Digital Marketer

### Web3 Experience Level

- Beginner
- Intermediate
- Advanced

## Contributing to the Index

To make this the go-to resource index for aspiring and current Web3 practitioners, we have to make it as seamless as possible to add resources to the index. As this is a fairly new project, I am still figuring out the best ways to go about this, and will update this README as soon as we come up with a framework. Suggestions are welcome regardless.

## Accessing the Index

## Roadmap

In order to launch this as quickly as possible, the initial version of the interactive index will be open-sourced via GitHub and hosted on a WordPress website. However, I'd like to show the possibilities and benefits of using [the Web3 stack](https://edgeandnode.com/blog/defining-the-web3-stack/) to build usable, practical web apps. Hence, the intended roadmap is as follows:

1. Host the open-source index on [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz)
2. Host all indexed resources (including details and metadata) on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/)
3. Query indexed resources via [The Graph Protocol](http://thegraph.com/en/)
