# Web3 Resource Index

Community-driven index of Web3 resources, for technical and non-technical folks alike. Search through tutorials, guides, libraries, apps, jobs and communities in the Web3 space.

## Inspiration

A lot of Web3 resources are scattered all over the Internet. However, they are hard to find or reference. For a beginner (or expert), it can be hard to navigate all the resources out there. Example: If I'm a UX designer new to Web3, what are the best resources for me to explore? Same goes for Product Managers, Developers and other tech practitioners. At the same time, as a mid-level developer working on a project, how do I find the most suitable open-source project or product for my use case? The list goes on and on...

Web3 Resource Index is my attempt at curating and organizing these resources in an interactive format, to make them easier to find according to each person's preference. On Web3ResourceIndex.com, you can find resources according to different criteria. At this time, some of the search criteria include:

### Resource Type

- Tutorials
- Guides
- Courses
- Communities
- Job Boards
- Developer Tools & Products
- Non-developer Tools & Products
- Books & Essays

### Blockchains

- Celo
- Solana
- Ethereum
- Bitcoin
- Polygon

### Career Path

- Developer
- Product Manager
- Founder
- Product Designer
- Technical Writer

### Web3 Experience Level

- Beginner
- Intermediate
- Advanced

## Contributing to the Index

To make this the go-to resource index for aspiring and current Web3 practitioners, we have to make it as seamless as possible to add resources to the index. As this is a fairly new project, I am still figuring out the best ways to go about this, and will update this README as soon as we come up with a framework. Suggestions are welcome regardless.
